## General info
I created this Trivia App for a coding challenge with the the following acceptance Criteria:

* A user can view questions.
* Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
* Questions should not repeat in a round.
* A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
* The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
* A user can see the score they received at the end of the round
Assumptions
* A round of trivia has 10 Questions
* All questions are multiple-choice questions
* Your score does not need to update in real time
* Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
* We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.
